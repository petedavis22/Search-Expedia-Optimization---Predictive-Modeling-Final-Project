# Search-Expedia-Optimization---Predictive-Modeling-Final-Project
In this project, our team took on a Kaggle competition from a few years back. The goal was to utilize consumer browsing patterns and search criteria on Expedia's site to accurately predict which hotel cluster a customer would end up booking from. Successfully predicting the hotel cluster would allow Expedia to optimize search results, listing hotels a customer is more likely to book, leading to greater conversion rates and greater customer satisfaction. We utilized a variety of machine learning techniques to try and come up with the best prediction.

The code can be found in the file titled APM Project.ipynb. (Warning - it is a big file that often has trouble loading on GitHub. It might be better to download.)
